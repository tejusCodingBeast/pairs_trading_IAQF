The paper discusses the use of statistical and machine learning methods for generating eligible pairs for pairs trading, a popular trading strategy. Pairs trading involves profiting from
deviations in prices or returns of two assets that converge to their mean in the long run, typically based on mean reversion and station-
ary stochastic processes. However, relying on correlation or co-integration assumes linearity,
which may not always hold. Thus, non-linear techniques like copulas or machine learning are gaining attention. The statistical methods pre-
sented include co-integration and Hurst exponent analysis to shortlist pairs that exhibited mean reverting spreads. The machine learning methods presented include using Cluster Anal-
ysis to congregate analogous ETFs. The paper also discusses different trading strategies that
can be used on eligible ETF pairs. It involves comparing novel trading approaches based on statistical Copulas and Reinforcement Learning agent to trade pairs and evaluating their performance against a benchmark of baseline
strategy based on Bollinger bands.
